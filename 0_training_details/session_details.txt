Hi,

I have registered for a training with Enrollment ID: 9557192

When I referred to the steps which I got in email to setup LVC, things did not work since it is internal training

To avoid any last minute issues,  I would like contact trainer or training partner to set the things up properly before the first session.

Let me know the contact of trainer or training partner so that I can check the setup requirements and pre-requisites before the first session.

Thanks
Ratnakar
