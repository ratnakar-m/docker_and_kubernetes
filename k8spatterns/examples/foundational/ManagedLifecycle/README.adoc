== Managed Lifecycle

For this simple example, you need access to a Kubernetes installation.
Anyone as described in link:../../INSTALL.adoc[INSTALL] is good enough.

Our sample https://github.com/k8spatterns/random-generator[random-genertore] application provides a `/shutdown` endpoint which we use to log its call during shutdown of a Pod.

But lets create the Pod first:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f pod.yml
----

and verify its status with

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods -w
----

As you can see, the Pod only starts  only after 30s because we use a `sleep 30` as preStart hool (you can't even check the logs before).

In order to watch the logs during shutdown we start a `kubectl logs` in the background:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs -f random-generator &
----

You can see the `postStart` message which has been picked up by random generator during startup and copied to the standard output of the application container.
The environment variable `WAIT_FOR_POST_START` that we set for our main application container indicates the random generator application to wait until the postStart file has been created:

----
io.k8spatterns.examples.RandomGeneratorApplication - Waiting for postStart to be finished ....
io.k8spatterns.examples.RandomGeneratorApplication - Waiting for postStart to be finished ....
io.k8spatterns.examples.RandomGeneratorApplication - Waiting for postStart to be finished ....
io.k8spatterns.examples.RandomGeneratorApplication - postStart Message: Wake up!
....
----

Now let's kill the Pod:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete pod random-generator
----

You should see in the logs messages like the following which indicate that our `/shutdown` endpoint as been called indeed:

----
....
i.k.examples.RandomGeneratorApplication  : SHUTDOWN NOW
o.s.s.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor  : Shutting down ExecutorService 'applicationTaskExecutor'
i.k.examples.RandomGeneratorApplication  : >>>> SHUTDOWN HOOK called. Possibly because of a SIGTERM from Kubernetes
----

NOTE: You could also use OpenShift for this example, e.g. by using Minishift. In this case you could also examine the log of the container after this has been finished, with `oc debug`. This is not possible with Kubernetes, so we start the log output command before we kill the Pod.
