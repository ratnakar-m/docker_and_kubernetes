A Docker image is a private file system just for your container. It provides all the files and code your container needs.

Now that you've run a container, what is a container? Simply put, a container is simply another process on your machine that has been isolated from all other processes on the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups, features that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker has worked to make these capabilities approachable and easy to use.
