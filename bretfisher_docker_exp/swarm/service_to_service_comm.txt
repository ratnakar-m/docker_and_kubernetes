scenario 1:

drupal - replica 1

able to demonstrate inter service communication
 - able to create a site with the site metadata going to DB (implies drupal service is able to communicate to psql)
able to demonstarte routing
 - no matter what node is given in the URL, it always routes to the node with drupal running


Note if the volumes of drupal and psql are maintained pointed correctly by services, then the multiple replicas works smoothly. If there are no volumes associated for either drupal or pssql, then there will be unexpected behavior.
