You can use "prune" commands to clean up images, volumes, build cache, and containers. Examples include:

docker system df =>to see space usage.

docker image prune => to clean up just "dangling" images 

docker image prune -a => which will remove all images you're not using

docker system prune => will clean up everything

docker system prune -a
